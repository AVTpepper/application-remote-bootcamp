# application-remote-bootcamp
This is my application for a remote bootcamp
I have tried a couple times with coding before. It was challenging to do it all by myself without a tutorial. I tried to recall a few things that I could manage on my own
Through my website it looks like I have gone back to the 90's on how basic it looks.
Lots of fun :)
