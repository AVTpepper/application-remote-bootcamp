  <p> 
    My given word is <mark><b>"Framework"</b></mark>. My immedieate understanding of what it means is that there is something in place to help with a <em>process</em>, 
    or there are <em>guidelines</em> to how something works , or a starting point in which you can continue to add things to or <em>develop from</em>.
  </p>
  <P>
    That was my first understanding of the word. However, from a little more research I got the definition according to Oxford Languages:
    <em>"a basic structure underlying a system, concept, or text"</em>. 
  </P>
  <p>
    Furthermore, this is what <b>framework</b> means in terms of web development:<em>"a set of resources and tools for software developers to 
      build and manage web applications, web services and websites".</em> 
  </p>
